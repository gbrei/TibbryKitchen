## About the Collection

This collection consists of recipe cards and printouts that I have affixed to my kitchen cabinets.  They are recipes that are tried and true, constantly being improved and updated, and have fed many friend/relative.  

Some of the recipes are passed down from generation to generation. Some are found on the internet and adapted/edited/"improved."  I like to think of recipes as a form of oral tradition that eventually gets written down and then adapted as needed.
