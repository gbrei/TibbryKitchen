## About the Collection

This collection consists of recipe cards and printouts that I have affixed to my kitchen cabinets.  They are recipes that are tried and true, constantly being improved and updated, and have fed many friend/relative.  

Some of the recipes are passed down from generation to generation. Some are found on the internet and adapted/edited/"improved."  I like to think of recipes as a form of oral tradition that eventually gets written down and then adapted as needed.  



This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
